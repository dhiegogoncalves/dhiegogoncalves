# Dhiego Gonçalves da Silva 👨‍💻

### Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 11 years of experience in software development, focusing on back-end, microservices architecture, and high-scale systems, with working knowledge of modern front-end technologies.
Currently at **Bemobi**, I develop solutions for the **payment ecosystem**, including **Pix, credit and debit cards, bank slips**, and **international payments**, integrating with **payment gateways** to ensure reliability, security, and scalability.
I work across the entire development lifecycle, from implementation to production, with a strong focus on **infrastructure as code (Terraform)**, **CI/CD**, **automated deployments**, **observability**, **resilience patterns** (fallback, retry, circuit breaker), and **event-driven architecture**.

💡 I'm passionate about clean architecture, automation, distributed systems, and building scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.
